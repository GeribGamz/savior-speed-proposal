SAVIOR SPEED WIREFRAME REFLECTION QUESTIONS

1 - What's different about your desktop and phone layouts?
    The main thing that's different is that each element is more spread out on the mobile version compared to the desktop version because of the larger width:height ratio.

2 - Which UI/HUD elements did you move, hide, or resize? Why?
    On the main menu, the game choices (New Game, Continue, etc.) had to be changed from a simple list of choices to buttons to make it easier for mobile players to select their choice.

3 - What did you notice about designing for real screen sizes?
    On mobile, a lot of things have to be scaled down when porting from the desktop version in order to fit on the screen.

4 - How would a player's experience change between the two versions?
    For Savior Speed, a mobile version isn't exactly planned, but if it were to be executed, it would most likely use touch controls compared to the keyboard/controller controls that the desktop version has.
