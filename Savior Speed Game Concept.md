## ðŸŽ® Game Design Concept \- Savior Speed

Page 1: General Ideas  
Title \- SAVIOR SPEED  
	Supposed to be a play on the idea of saving your friends throughout the game and going fast.

Genre \- 2D Side-Scrolling Platformer

Progression \- (Could change): 5 Areas with 5 levels \+ 1 boss fight in each world

* Each level is meant to have a unique style \+ gimmick.  
  * Idea \- An island that is also a skatepark: Lots of places for railgrinding (The levels unique movement mechanic)  
  * Each level also has 3 hidden creatures to incentivise looking around and rewarding using your abilities well.  
  * Each Area also has a character specific level that is built based off the abilities of the character it is for (Ex: Gammaâ€™s level is mainly vertical due to her jump power)

Movement \+ Abilities:

* 5 Playable Characters, each having unique abilities and differences to each other  
  * Example: Ritter (The main character) has the most balanced stats, while Gamma (The first unlock) favors vertical movement.  
* Abilities:  
  * Analog Stick / D-pad: Move (Press down to crouch, press up to look up)  
  * Button 1: Jump, Double Jump  
  * Button 2: Attacking (Jabs, Aerials, Dash Attacks, stuff like that)  
  * Button 3: Dash (While held, the character moves faster)  
  * Button 4: Special (Does something unique to the character while on the ground or in the air) (Also is the main button used for gimmicks)

Style \- Mainly a cartoony art style, but also has some unique stylization for certain characters and levels (I.E. A character that is only animated via key poses or a comic shaded level)

Challenge \- This game requires the player to perform precise platforming along with having lots of abilities to help make the player go very fast and be able to trim what used to be a 5-6 minute attempt for a level down to less than a minute. (In other words, it encourages the player to complete levels as fast as they can.)

Page 2: Playable Characters

* Ritter Wayne  
  * A green jacket donning, long nosed freak of nature that has great agility and an ecstatic personality. When his friends got kidnapped, he knew immediately what he had to do, save them as fast as he possibly could.

* Gamma Sether  
  * Wearing pink overalls and a black skirt, Gamma is Ritterâ€™s best friend. She is well known between the cast to be able to jump quite high compared to the average folk. She is quite mature and usually is able to keep the group under control when things get out of hand. Unfortunately for her, she, along with everyone else besides Ritter, would be captured by the Speed God for what seemed to be no reason at all.

* Richard Jones
  * Despite growing up a farmboy, this wild individual is by far the strongest individual between the group. He is known for his ability to chop metal in half, making it look like snapping a twig in half. Compared to everyone else however, he isnâ€™t exactly the fastest member of the group. Despite his comically powerful build, he wasnâ€™t able to break free from the Speed Godâ€™s grasp when it captured him and the others.

* The Speedster  
  * Real name: Gabriel Appens. This amazingly fast individual is well known for his incredible speed in everything, hence the nickname. The Speedster has been banned from every single Olympic game that involves running due to him winning every single time he competes by a landslide and people just getting bored of him. He and Ritter are known for their rivalry as Ritter constantly tries to outspeed him at something (Ritter loses every single time). However, the Speedster was caught off guard one day as he and everyone else got captured by the Speed God.

 

* Mallop  
  * Nobody truly knows where they came from, not even they do. Mallop is known as Mr. Chaos in the group as most of the time, their shenanigans is what gets the group into various scenarios that shouldnâ€™t really involve them. As a matter of fact, the only reason Mallop was even captured was because they were asleep when they got kidnapped and only woke up once they were freed by the gang later.

Page 3: Boss Characters

* The Speed God (The Main Antagonist \+ Final Boss)   
  * The god of speed as well as the creator of the aisles that the game takes place in. This creature is composed of two floating eyes and a gaping mouth attached to a floating base that is  The Speed God ends up capturing the gang mainly due to its huge grudge against primarily Ritter for besting it in a 100-meter dash a long time ago. But at the same time, the Speed God also wants to see Ritter improve and test his skills in the aisles to see if Ritter truly deserved to beat the Speed God.  
* Mike Mayhem (Boss 1):  
  * Isnâ€™t actually named Mike Mayhem, just calls himself that since he thinks itâ€™s cool despite nobody else agreeing. His real name is Mike Wayne, brother to Ritter Wayne. Mike was paid by the Speed God to try and stop Ritter from saving Gamma, to which he agreed to because of his vendetta against his brother for making a fool of him constantly when they were younger.

Page 4: The Story

Explaining the opening cutscene:  
	Chilling on one Thursday afternoon, Ritter and his friends were mainly winding down for the day after another ordinary day. Mallop was already fast asleep, Gamma was enjoying her favorite book, Richard and the Speedster were playing a card game with each other, and Ritter was just relaxing on a chair, watching the others do their activities. Thatâ€™s when out of nowhere, a gigantic hand breaks through their front door and grabs everyone except Ritter. The main antagonist, the Speed God, shows its face and laughs with what appears to be an evil intention. The Speed God then leaves the house, group still in hand, which really ticked off Ritter. Ritter then begins to chase after the Speed God, of which is guiding Ritter to the aisles where all of the levels take place. It looks as if Ritter wants to get his friends back, heâ€™ll have to go through the aisles to make it to the tower at which the Speed God resides, saving his friends along the way.

Level cutscenes:  
	Each level will have a little cutscene of whatever character youâ€™re playing as acknowledging their surroundings and making a comment on it to add a bit of charm to the characters. Each boss fight will have a bit of banter between the player and the boss. The boss fight banter will change depending on two factors: what character the player is and if this is the first time the player is fighting the boss. The boss cutscenes will help build character for the bosses as well as show the chemistry between each character and boss.

Page 5: Player Interactivity  
Inspired by games such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Wario Land 4, Pizza Tower, and Antonblast with its main focus being on platforming and going fast.

This game is meant to be a platformer that has a control scheme that is easy to pick up, hard to master as the level design has to be fun while taking your time as well as speeding through it as fast as possible. However, the game will encourage the player to try and speed through it as quickly as possible by granting the player several movement options to blaze through obstacles.

The game also has some replay value as each character plays a bit different from one another, meaning that how they approach each level will vary depending on which character is being played as. For example, Richardâ€™s main gimmick is being the only character that can break metal blocks, allowing him to take unique routes that the other characters cannot (inspired by Knuckles having different levels compared to Sonic and Tails in various 2D Sonic games).

The main appeal of the game is being able to take what at first seems like annoying obstacles and turning them into a way to build up momentum and improve how fast you can speed through a level. It also is meant to feel snappy with its quick movements and simple to read yet fluid animation.

OVERALL: Savior Speed is meant to be a fun experience that has appeals for both casual players and those that want to fully show their skills with its colorful artstyle and simple yet challenging mechanics. The story is meant to be a fun side thing that can help people get attached and invested into whatâ€™s going on and have an extra motivation towards completing the game.
